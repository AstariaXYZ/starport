## âœ¨ Starport: Lending Kernel

Starport is a kernel for building lending protocols. A lending protocol can be implemented by inheriting and implementing the interfaces `Pricing`, `Status`, and `Settlement`. To learn more about how Starport works read the [Starport whitepaper](https://github.com/AstariaXYZ/starport-whitepaper/blob/master/starport-whitepaper.pdf).
